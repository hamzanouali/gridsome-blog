## What is a Landing Page?

A landing page is a common asset and standalone web page, created specifically for an advertising or marketing campaign. It’s where a visitor lands after they click on a link in an email, or from Google, Bing, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook,  or similar places on the web.

Let's get this out of the way. Your homepage is not a landing page nor a place to show off your creativity. Design and creativity are important, of course, but function and content are the real reasons people come and stick around. let this sink all the way in and don’t ever forget it.

That said, let’s jump to 11 Best Practices for optimizing a landing page :

Your landing pages have to be very clear about your product and attract your visitor’s attention from the start. People’s attention span is just about [8 - 9 seconds,](http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/08/08/this-is-your-brain-on-visualization/) so you have to make sure you tell all the important stuff first and tell it as fast as possible to get more clicks, sales, and conversions.

Customer retention is the most important key to profits. The lower barrier and flexibility to the entry of monthly subscription is crucial for acquiring new users, but you can’t deny that if customers bail out on your product services, you won’t see the money you need to survive, let alone prosper and grow your business.

Creating an annual subscription plan guarantees most of the customers will be around for at least 12 months. That’s a big step up in customer lifetime value, and you will have more time to engage with the customer and ensure the fulfillment of the product was successful.

This is an awesome opportunity to get paid for months upfront, which will increase your cash flow and help you recover customer acquisition costs.

You should understand is that both plans benefit your business, and offering the customer a choice won’t necessarily harm your business. As long as you're clear with your pricing strategies and also in displaying a monthly and annual subscription options, the flexibility will ensure you can serve different buyers at different stages in the customer life cycle.
